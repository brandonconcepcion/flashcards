## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd study-flashcards
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

## Using LaTeX Math

### Writing Mathematical Formulas

1. Use `$...$` for inline math: `$E = mc^2$`
2. Use `$$...$$` for block equations: `$$\int_0^1 x^2 dx$$`
3. Preview your formulas in real-time while creating flashcards

- The app includes intelligent mock AI that can:
  - Extract technical terms from your text
  - Generate basic summaries
  - Suggest flashcards based on identified concepts

## How to Use

### Adding Flashcards

1. Go to the "Add Cards" tab
2. Enter your question and answer (with LaTeX math support!)
3. Use "LaTeX Help" button to see syntax examples
4. Click "Preview LaTeX" to see your math rendered
5. Optionally add a category
6. Click "AI Analyze" to get:
   - A summary of your answer
   - Extracted key concepts
   - Suggested additional flashcards
7. Click "Add Flashcard" to save

### Using LaTeX Math

- **Inline formulas**: Wrap in single dollar signs: `$E = mc^2$`
- **Block formulas**: Wrap in double dollar signs: `$$\int_0^1 x^2 dx$$`
- **Common examples**:
  - Fractions: `$\frac{a}{b}$`
  - Square roots: `$\sqrt{x}$`
  - Subscripts: `$x_1$`
  - Superscripts: `$x^2$`
  - Greek letters: `$\alpha, \beta, \gamma$`
  - Summations: `$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$`

### Studying

1. Go to "Study Mode"
2. Filter by category if desired
3. Click cards to flip between question and answer
4. Rate your knowledge (Easy/Medium/Hard) to track progress
5. Use navigation buttons to move between cards

### Managing Cards

1. Go to "Manage Cards" to see all your flashcards
2. View statistics about your study progress
3. Search through your cards
4. Edit or delete cards as needed

## Technical Features

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and better development experience
- **React Hooks**: Modern React patterns with custom hooks
- **Local Storage**: Persistent data storage without external dependencies
- **Responsive CSS**: Mobile-first design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration with fallback mock services
- **LaTeX Rendering**: KaTeX integration for mathematical formulas
- **Real-time Preview**: Live LaTeX rendering as you type

## Example Use Cases

### Interview Preparation

- Add complex technical questions and detailed answers

- Generate focused flashcards for each concept
- Study with spaced repetition

### Learning New Technologies

- Paste documentation or tutorial content
- Get AI-generated summaries
- Create flashcards for important terms and concepts
- Track your learning progress

### Academic Study

- Convert lecture notes into flashcards with mathematical formulas
