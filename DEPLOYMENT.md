# Deployment Guide

Your Study Flashcards app is now ready to deployy! Here are several options for hosting your personal website, including automated CI/CD deployment:

## ðŸš€ CI/CD Automated Deployment (Recommended)

Set up automatic deployment so every time you push changes to GitHub, your site automatically rebuilds and deploys!

### GitHub Actions Workflows Included:
- **Netlify**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Vercel**: `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml` 
- **GitHub Pages**: `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml`

Choose ONE workflow based on your preferred hosting platform.

## Option 1: Netlify (Recommended - Free & Easy)

   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder directly onto the Netlify dashboard

## What's Included in Your Build

Your `dist` folder contains:
- âœ… Optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- âœ… All LaTeX math rendering fonts
- âœ… Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- âœ… All your flashcard functionality
- âœ… Local storage for data persistence

## Important Notes

- **Data Storage**: Your flashcards are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they'll persist on the device where you use the app
- **AI Features**: If you want to use AI features, you'll need to add your OpenAI API key in the app
- **No Backend Required**: This is a static site that runs entirely in the browser
- **HTTPS**: Most hosting providers automatically provide HTTPS, which is recommended

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Most hosting providers allow you to use a custom domain:
1. Buy a domain from any registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Point the domain to your hosting provider
3. Configure it in your hosting provider's dashboard

## Recommended: Netlify Deployment

For the easiest deployment, I recommend Netlify:

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Drag and drop your `dist` folder onto the dashboard
4. Your site is live!

Your flashcards app will be accessible from anywhere, and all your data will be saved locally in each browser you use it in.
